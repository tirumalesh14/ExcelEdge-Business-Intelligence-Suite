This project demonstrates how Microsoft Excel can be used as a powerful business intelligence tool to analyze, interpret, and visualize data for decision-making. Through a series of interconnected mini-projects, the Excel workbook provides a structured approach to understanding key business metrics across sales performance, financial health, loan planning, budgeting, and customer profitability.

Rather than just processing data, this project focuses on transforming data into insight, and insight into action—empowering businesses to make informed decisions using dashboards, simulations, and financial models built entirely within Excel.
